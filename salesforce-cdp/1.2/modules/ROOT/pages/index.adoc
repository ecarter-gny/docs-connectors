= Salesforce Data Cloud Connector 1.2 - Mule 4

Anypoint Connector for Salesforce Data Cloud (Salesforce Data Cloud Connector) provides a quick and easy way to integrate with Salesforce Data Cloud API endpoints. You can automate data ingestion from third parties, query the Data Cloud Data Lake, search and query customer profile information and calculated insights, and consume data action events to enrich the 360-degree view of the customers in your Data Cloud instance.

Each API call uses a request/response pattern over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are built into the connector.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, refer to the Salesforce Data Cloud Connector release notes.
